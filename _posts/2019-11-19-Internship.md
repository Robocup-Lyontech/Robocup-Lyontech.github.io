We are looking for two or three candidates for an internship, in order to complete our robocup team. 

## Main goal: 
Enhance our robot [OPL](https://robocup-lyontech.github.io/opl/) (PALbator) and [SSPL](https://robocup-lyontech.github.io/sspl/) (Pepper) with new features. Implemement those features in robocup scenario. Rules available [here](https://github.com/RoboCupAtHome/RuleBook) (clone and make content) or [an old compiled version](https://robocup-lyontech.github.io/assets/pdf/Rulebook_robocup_2020-11-25.pdf)

## Why is it great ?
You will participate to the **biggest robotic competition** with :
 - 3 500 participants
 - 5 000 robots
 - 45 represented countries
 - 70 000 spectators

The team earned already a good reputation :
- **Best scientific paper** in 2019 at RCS
- **3rd** rank in 2019 at Robocup@Home SSPL
- 5th rank in 2018 at Robocup@Home SSPL
- 3rd rank in 2014 at Robocup@Work

You will compete with/against world **top-level** teams, work on **most recent technologies**, learn thousands of different things, and in the same time you will not really know if you are playing or working !

Be part of a team composed of robotics  experts and researchers mainly from CITI LAb. Inria [Chroma Team](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/)


## Internship topic details 
### Internship 1 (mainly at CPE): Human-robot interface for robocup scenarios
- OPL : 
  - Full hardware implementation of the tablet and the speech recogition on the robot. 
- OPL and if possible SSPL :
  - Develop **Speech recognition** and dialog capacity
  - End the work done on the tablet (mainly javascript)
- SSPL & OPL:
  - Ensure scenarios compatibility on the two plateforms
  - Collaborate to the "Clean up" and "Receptionist" scenarios which will be your test case on the 2 robots

### Internship 2 (mainly at CPE): Ojects management and application to the "Clean Up" (the floor) robocup scenario
- For OPL and SSPL : Detecting objects (**deeplearning**), 3D localisation for pointing and grasping, Objets taxonomy
- For OPL only : Grasping objects with motion strategies adapted to each objects
- "Clean up" scenarios : Develop and test the "Clean Up" scenario on the 2 robots. First without grasping for the 2 robots. Then with grasping for OPL

### Internship 3 (mainly at CITI-Lab): Constraint Naviguation 
- SSPL :
  - Naviguation and SLAM based on  RTAB-Map with  Pepper Robot (external computer device and embedded )
  - Naviguation strategies for constraint environnements as door crossing with  rotation, translation and update of the map
  - Benchmarking of influence of network capcacities
- SSPL & OPL : 
  - Definition of Restaurant scenario 
  - Premilary work on people following 



## When and where ? 
The internship starts in February 2020 and ends in July 2020. Depending on the topic, the student will work either in CPE Lyon or in CITI-Lab. The 20th to the 28th of June we whole team will be at the competition in Bordeaux.
