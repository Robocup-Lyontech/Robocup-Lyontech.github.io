## PALO IT, a new partner for LyonTech Team !

PALO IT is a global innovation consultancy and Agile software development company. They work with clients to rapidly launch products and services, create new business models, and prepare leadership and culture for positive social and environmental impact.

Already for the 2021 edition, Simon ERNST, member of the PALO IT team and former CPE student joined us for the competition. This year, PALO IT is officially joining the LyonTech team for the 2023 edition of the RoboCup@Home to bring another expertise in robotics and software development.

Thank you for the trust and commitment you bring to our team and to this beautiful project that is the RoboCup!
