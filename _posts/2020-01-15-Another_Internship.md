We are opening an intern position within the team on the themes of Robot Navigation & Mapping !

## Main goal: 

Enhance robot capabilities in terms of navigation strategies specific situations (crossing doors, going backwards, ...)
and perception (exploring the use of the RTABMAP and OCTOMAP frameworks).

The robot you will focus your experiments on will mainly be Pepper,
but being able to apply this on our Open Platform (Palbator) would be great !

If this piqued your interest, don't hesitate to take a look at the [full proposition here](/assets/pdf/PFE\ Robotique\ -\ Robocup\ 2020.pdf) and send us a message !
