## LyonTech Foundation

**La Doua - LyonTech** is the main technology campus of Lyon, France. This campus is home to 25000 students, 1500 researchers and 1200 PhD students, spread out over a 100 hectare area.
Different organizations inside the campus gathered to create the **LyonTech team** in order to participate to the **Robocup@home challenge**. The **LyonTech team members* belong to three teaching entities, two research laboratories, and mainly to the Chroma research team from INRIA : 
3 teaching entities and 2 laboratories compose the team :

- **CPE Lyon**, Engineering school\footnotemark[1], former robocup team in 2013 and 2016
- **INSA Lyon**, Engineering school\footnotemark[1], candidate for robocup 2016 organization
- **University Claude Bernard Lyon 1** and its engineering school\footnotemark[1] Polytech Lyon
- **CITI Lab.**, Centre of Innovation in Telecommunications and Integration of Service (INRIA)
- **INRIA**, Computer science and Mathematics laboratory
- **LIRIS**, Vision and information system laboratory (CNRS)


## Teaching involvement
The 3 teaching entities mentioned in introduction are very active in the robotic field.

-**CPE Lyon** is a 130 years old engineering school (chemistry and computer science diplomas) that oers a "service robotics" speciality (fourth and fifth year), based on software development for robotics (the robotic framework ROS), embedded systems, and a bit of mechatronics. The courses are based on a lot of practical work on dierent platforms (custom ROS plateforms, Youbot, Baxter,
Naos, Peppers, Turtlebots, UAVs ...). To finish their training, students have to work on a robotic project. Robocup@home is a convenient opportunity for students to work on a challenging global project, so we decided to keep working on this Robocup@home project for the following years.

-**INSA Lyon** is a leading engineering school belonging to the French INSA institute (National Institute of Applied Sciences). INSA Lyon boasts 23 research laboratories, more than 600 researchers and teacher-researchers, 650 PhD students and over 1,000 industrial contracts with the socio-economic world. It has been now 4 years that the Telecom Department has been oering a "Robotics & A.I." specialization during the fifth year. Students are trained to autonomous navigation (perception, mapping, planning) and multi-robot cooperation. They also carry out a project, under ROS system, with mobile robots among one Pepper humanoid, 20 Turtlebot robots and 5 Parrot Bibop UAVs. Since 2017 some of them are working on human-aware navigation with Pepper for the Robocup@home project.

-**Polytech Lyon** is an engineering school integrated to University Claude Bernard Lyon 1. The school's IT Department oers an "agent and multi-agent systems" module that focuses on artificial intelligence, considering various learning approaches (machine learning, developmental learning) or bio-inspired methods.
Specificc courses in this module are dedicated to a project where students have to apply these techniques to robotics, using robotic framework ROS and a platform composed of mobile robots. Robocup@home provides a suitable and motivating setting for this project.
