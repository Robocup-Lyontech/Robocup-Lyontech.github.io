## LyonTech Foundation

**La Doua - LyonTech** is the main technology campus of Lyon, France. This campus is home to 25000 students, 1500 researchers and 1200 PhD students, spread out over a 100 hectare area.
Different organizations inside the campus gathered to create the **LyonTech team** in order to participate to the **Robocup@home challenge**. The **LyonTech team members* belong to three teaching entities, two research laboratories, and mainly to the Chroma research team from INRIA : 
3 teaching entities and 2 laboratories compose the team :

- **CPE Lyon**, Engineering school\footnotemark[1], former robocup team in 2013 and 2016
- **INSA Lyon**, Engineering school\footnotemark[1], candidate for robocup 2016 organization
- **University Claude Bernard Lyon 1** and its engineering school\footnotemark[1] Polytech Lyon
- **CITI Lab.**, Centre of Innovation in Telecommunications and Integration of Service (INRIA)
- **INRIA**, Computer science and Mathematics laboratory
- **LIRIS**, Vision and information system laboratory (CNRS)


## Teaching involvement
The 3 teaching entities mentioned in introduction are very active in the robotic field.

- **CPE Lyon** is a 130 years old engineering school (chemistry and computer science diplomas) that oers a "service robotics" speciality (fourth and fifth year), based on software development for robotics (the robotic framework ROS), embedded systems, and a bit of mechatronics. The courses are based on a lot of practical work on dierent platforms (custom ROS plateforms, Youbot, Baxter,
Naos, Peppers, Turtlebots, UAVs ...). To finish their training, students have to work on a robotic project. Robocup@home is a convenient opportunity for students to work on a challenging global project, so we decided to keep working on this Robocup@home project for the following years.

- **INSA Lyon** is a leading engineering school belonging to the French INSA institute (National Institute of Applied Sciences). INSA Lyon boasts 23 research laboratories, more than 600 researchers and teacher-researchers, 650 PhD students and over 1,000 industrial contracts with the socio-economic world. It has been now 4 years that the Telecom Department has been offering a "Robotics & A.I." specialization during the fifth year. Students are trained to autonomous navigation (perception, mapping, planning) and multi-robot cooperation. They also carry out a project, under ROS system, with mobile robots among one Pepper humanoid, 20 Turtlebot robots and 5 Parrot Bibop UAVs. Since 2017 some of them are working on human-aware navigation with Pepper for the Robocup@home project.

- **Polytech Lyon** is an engineering school integrated to University Claude Bernard Lyon 1. The school's IT Department offers an "agent and multi-agent systems" module that focuses on artificial intelligence, considering various learning approaches (machine learning, developmental learning) or bio-inspired methods.
Specificc courses in this module are dedicated to a project where students have to apply these techniques to robotics, using robotic framework ROS and a platform composed of mobile robots. Robocup@home provides a suitable and motivating setting for this project.

## Research competences

Research on robotics and application are well developed and structured. Two laboratories are involved in the **LyonTech** team.

- **CITI** is an academic laboratory associated with INSA Lyon and INRIA. The CITI Laboratory develops research activities bringing together computer science, networking, and digital communications to address the challenging issues related
to the development of IoT,  eet of connected vehicles and robots. The Lab. houses around 100 people, who are organized in 6 teams (see http://www.citi-lab.fr/). Among these teams, Chroma is an INRIA team-project dedicated to human-aware navigation and multi-robot systems (https://team.inria.fr/chroma). Jacques Saraydaryan, Fabrice Jumel, Laetitia Matignon, Christian Wolf and Olivier Simonin are members of the Chroma team (led by Prof. O. Simonin), which researchs focus on human-aware robot navigation and cooperation in dynamic environments.

- **LIRIS** is a laboratory of the French Center of National Research (CNRS) with more than 300 researchers (140 research sta) from University of Lyon working in a variety of computer science fields: Computer Vision, Machine Learning and AI, geometry and modeling, data science, services, distributed systems, security, simulation, virtuality, computational sciences, interactions and cognition. The
members involved in the LyonTech project are part of two dierent work groups, namely the Computer Vision Group (Imagine) and the Multi Agent Systems Group (SMA).

The **Robocup@home** challenge is an opportunity for team members to work on their specialties (image analysis, navigation, robot 
eet management). It helps them to define use cases to drive research focus. For example the cases of robot waiter and tour guide robot are directly considered in our study benchmarks for navigation.
