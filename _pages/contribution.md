# Software contributions

* **[General Orchestrator](https://github.com/jacques-saraydaryan/robocup_pepper-general_mng)**  : we developed a General Orchestrator allowing the robot to coordinate its capacities (navigation, perception, interaction) and make decision on defined scenario.

* **[Navigation Manager](https://github.com/jacques-saraydaryan/robocup_pepper-navigation_mng)** : this functionality provide a set of navigation strategy depending on the observed context. Regarding to the context (lots of people, complex environment, large free space zone), the robot changes it way of navigation.

* **Perception** : in order to interact with people we developed a set of tools that accumulate knowledge about observed human.
        - **[Face recognition](https://github.com/jacques-saraydaryan/ros_face_recognition)** : a solution was developed to automatically catch face and learn it for future detection.
        - **[Color detection](https://github.com/jacques-saraydaryan/ros_color_detection)** : we extract main colors of a given picture (e.g t-shir, trousers) based on HSV format and K-mean clustering 
        - **[Pose detection](https://github.com/m0rph03nix/ros_openpose_gossip)** : based on the OpenPose data, we build a pose extractor gives us the estimate pose (stand, sit, lying down, left or right arm up,...)
