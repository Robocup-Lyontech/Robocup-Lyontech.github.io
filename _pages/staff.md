- Fabrice Jumel is professor assistant  in [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School). He is at the head of the robotic of service specialty . He is a member of the [CHROMA INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/)  team of the [CITI Lab](http://www.citi-lab.fr/)  (Cooperative and Human-aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments). He like [Robocup](http://www.robocup.org/) and Robocup like competitions. He is team leader of a [robocup@home](http://cpe-dev.fr/robotcup/) team and was previously team leader of robocup@work one. He's more precisely involved in social navigation, fleet of robots, robot assistant for elder or disease peoples. 

- Jacques Saraydaryan hold a Master’s Degree in Telecoms and Networks from Télécom Saint-Etienne, France in 2005, and a Ph.D. in computer sciences from National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA), Lyon France in 2009. He was a Research Engineer at the Exaprotect Company, France during seven years. His research focus began on IS Security especially on Anomaly intrusion detection system. Currently, he's a member of the engineers School of [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School) as associate professor. His experience into behavior modeling helps him to integrate the robotic research team of the school. He joins the [CITI Lab](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) in 2015 and becomes associate members of the [CHROMA INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/) team. Research interests are focused on Human and Robot Interaction and especially on managing robot fleet to deliver service to human into crowed environment.

- Christian Wolf is associate professor (Maitre de Conférences, HDR) at [INSA de Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr) and [LIRIS UMR 5205](http://liris.cnrs.fr), a [CNRS](http://cnrs.fr) laboratory, since 2005. Since sept. 2017 he is on leave at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr) at the [Chroma](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/chroma) robotics work group and the [CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/). He is interested in computer vision and machine learning, deep learning, especially in the visual analysis of complex scenes in motion: gesture and activity recognition and pose estimation. In his work he puts an emphasis on models of complex interactions, on Deep Learning and on structured models. He received his MSc in computer science from Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) in 2000, and a PhD in computer science from INSA de Lyon, France, in 2003. In 2012 he obtained the habilitation diploma, also from INSA de Lyon.
