## Robocup LyonTech Team
Robocup LyonTech consortium is ready and motivated for Robocup@home thematics and especially for the Social Standard Platform.
We provide :
1. highly qualified researchers in several areas of robotics (robot navigation, robot control, computer vision); 
2. a fruitful collaboration between researchers and engineers; iii) past participations in the competition; 
3. the integration of a large number of highly qualified students from different engineering schools (eq. Universities); 
4. expertise on ROS and Naoqi frameworks.

## Members of Robocup LyonTech Team
- [**Jacques Saraydaryan**](https://jacques-saraydaryan.github.io/) (team leader) hold a Master’s Degree in Telecoms and Networks from Télécom Saint-Etienne, France in 2005, and a Ph.D. in computer sciences from National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA), Lyon France in 2009. He was a Research Engineer at the Exaprotect Company, France during seven years. His research focus began on IS Security especially on Anomaly intrusion detection system. Currently, he's a member of the engineers School of [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School) as associate professor. His experience into behavior modeling helps him to integrate the robotic research team of the school. He joins the [CITI Lab](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) in 2015 and becomes associate members of the [CHROMA INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/) team. Research interests are focused on Human and Robot Interaction and especially on managing robot fleet to deliver service to human into crowed environment.

- [**Fabrice Jumel**](https://fabricejumel.github.io/) is assistant professor in [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School). He is at the head of the "service robotics" major. He is a member of the [CHROMA INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/)  team of the [CITI Lab](http://www.citi-lab.fr/)  (Cooperative and Human-aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments). He likes [Robocup](http://www.robocup.org/) and Robocup like competitions. He was previously the team leader of a [robocup@home team](http://cpe-dev.fr/robotcup/) and was previously the team leader of a robocup@work one. He's more precisely involved in social navigation, fleet of robots, robot assistant for elder or disease peoples. 

- **Raphael Leber** is an assistant professor at [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School) since 2014. He develops robotic platorms and teaches in the "service robotics" major. Before working as an academic, he gained a relevant experience in a [Korean robotic laboratory](http://irl.postech.ac.kr), in a [former french robotic company](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en) and in a [company specialized in embedded systems](https://www.viveris.fr/index.php/viveris-technologies.html) (R&D and then R&I). He holds a Master’s Degree in Embedded Electronics from the University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard, 2010.

- **Eric Lombardi** is a computer science engineer at the [CNRS](http://cnrs.fr) and the [LIRIS UMR 5205](http://liris.cnrs.fr) research laboratory since 2006. He is involved in several research platforms in the field of computer vision. His main developments are about motion capture, augmented reality, gesture recognition and object tracking in videos.

- **Laetitia Matignon** is an associate professor at [University Claude Bernard Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr) in the [LIRIS UMR 5205](http://liris.cnrs.fr) laboratory, [SMA](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipes?id=74) (Multi-Agent System) team, since 2012. For the years 2016-2018,  she is also an associated member of the [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr) at the [Chroma](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/chroma) robotics work group and the [CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/).  She is interested  in Artificial Intelligence (AI),  especially decision processes under uncertainty (planification, reinforcement learning, developmental learning) and their applications to robotics (multi-robot and human-robot systems). She hold her Ph.D. in computer science and automatics from Franche-Comte University in December 2008, with a thesis on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning and its application to the control of a micro-manipulation distributed system. As a post-doctoral researcher at University of Caen in MAD team of [GREYC](https://archive-www.greyc.fr/index.html) laboratory, she was involved in the CAROTTE NRA-DGA project, a french robotic competition concerning the autonomous exploration and mapping of an unknown environment with mobile robotic systems.

- **Olivier Simonin** is Professor at INSA Lyon, Université de Lyon. He is the leader of the [CHROMA INRIA team](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/). He received his B.Sc., M.Sc. and PhD in Computer Science in 1995, 1997 and 2001 respectively, from Université Montpellier II (LIRMM Laboratory), France. From 2002 to 2006 he was an Associate Professor at UTBM "Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbeliard" (France) and member of the SET Lab. Then he moved to Université de Lorraine and to LORIA Lab. in Nancy as a member of the INRIA project-team MaIA (Autonomous and Intelligent Machines). In 2010, he completed his habilitation (French HDR diploma). In 2013, he became full Professor at INSA Lyon and CITI-Inria Lab. In 2015, he created the INRIA team CHROMA (Cooperative and Human-aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments), gathering some members from the CITI Lab and from Inria Grenoble Center (eMotion team). His main research topics are decentralized decision making, autonomous navigation, multi-agent systems (MAS) and multi-robot systems (MRS). Since 2002, he has published 12 articles in international journals and books and about 35 international conference long papers (in IROS, ICRA, AAMAS, IJCAI, etc.). He was the initiator of three european PHC projects (with Czech Rep., Slovenia and Romania) and an active member of several international and national projects (e.g. "InTraDe" european project, STIC-Asie "Scout", the ANR "Cartomatic" project winning the French robotic "Carotte" challenge in 2012).
