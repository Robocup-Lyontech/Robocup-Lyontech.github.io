Robocup LyonTech consortium is ready and motivated for Robocup@home thematics and especially for the Social Standard Platform.
We provide :
i) highly qualified researchers in several areas of robotics (robot navigation, robot control, computer vision); 
ii) a fruitful collaboration between researchers and engineers; iii) past participations in the competition; 
iv) the integration of a large number of highly qualified students from different engineering schools (eq. Universities); 
v) expertise on ROS and Naoqi frameworks.

- Fabrice Jumel is assistant professor in [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School). He is at the head of the "service robotics" major. He is a member of the [CHROMA INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/)  team of the [CITI Lab](http://www.citi-lab.fr/)  (Cooperative and Human-aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments). He likes [Robocup](http://www.robocup.org/) and Robocup like competitions. He is the team leader of a [robocup@home](http://cpe-dev.fr/robotcup/) team and was previously the team leader of a robocup@work one. He's more precisely involved in social navigation, fleet of robots, robot assistant for elder or disease peoples. 

- Jacques Saraydaryan hold a Master’s Degree in Telecoms and Networks from Télécom Saint-Etienne, France in 2005, and a Ph.D. in computer sciences from National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA), Lyon France in 2009. He was a Research Engineer at the Exaprotect Company, France during seven years. His research focus began on IS Security especially on Anomaly intrusion detection system. Currently, he's a member of the engineers School of [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School) as associate professor. His experience into behavior modeling helps him to integrate the robotic research team of the school. He joins the [CITI Lab](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) in 2015 and becomes associate members of the [CHROMA INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/) team. Research interests are focused on Human and Robot Interaction and especially on managing robot fleet to deliver service to human into crowed environment.

- Christian Wolf is associate professor (Maitre de Conférences, HDR) at [INSA de Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr) and [LIRIS UMR 5205](http://liris.cnrs.fr), a [CNRS](http://cnrs.fr) laboratory, since 2005. Since sept. 2017 he is on leave at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr) at the [Chroma](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/chroma) robotics work group and the [CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/). He is interested in computer vision and machine learning, deep learning, especially in the visual analysis of complex scenes in motion: gesture and activity recognition and pose estimation. In his work he puts an emphasis on models of complex interactions, on Deep Learning and on structured models. He received his MSc in computer science from Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) in 2000, and a PhD in computer science from INSA de Lyon, France, in 2003. In 2012 he obtained the habilitation diploma, also from INSA de Lyon.

- Raphael Leber is assistant professor in [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School) since 2014. He develops robotic platorms and teaches in the "service robotics" major. Before working as an academic, he gained a relevant experience in a [Korean robotic laboratory](http://irl.postech.ac.kr), in a [former french robotic company](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en) and in a [company specialized in embedded systems](https://www.viveris.fr/index.php/viveris-technologies.html) (R&D and then R&I). He holds a Master’s Degree in Embedded Electronics from the University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard, 2010.
