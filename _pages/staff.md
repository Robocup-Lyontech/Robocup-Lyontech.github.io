## Robocup LyonTech Team
Robocup LyonTech consortium is ready and motivated for Robocup@home thematics and especially for the Social Standard Platform.
We provide :
1. highly qualified researchers in several areas of robotics (robot navigation, robot control, computer vision); 
2. a fruitful collaboration between researchers and engineers; iii) past participations in the competition; 
3. the integration of a large number of highly qualified students from different engineering schools (eq. Universities); 
4. expertise on ROS and Naoqi frameworks.

## Members of Robocup LyonTech Team
- Fabrice Jumel (team leader) is assistant professor in [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School). He is at the head of the "service robotics" major. He is a member of the [CHROMA INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/)  team of the [CITI Lab](http://www.citi-lab.fr/)  (Cooperative and Human-aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments). He likes [Robocup](http://www.robocup.org/) and Robocup like competitions. He is the team leader of a [robocup@home](http://cpe-dev.fr/robotcup/) team and was previously the team leader of a robocup@work one. He's more precisely involved in social navigation, fleet of robots, robot assistant for elder or disease peoples. 

- Jacques Saraydaryan hold a Master’s Degree in Telecoms and Networks from Télécom Saint-Etienne, France in 2005, and a Ph.D. in computer sciences from National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA), Lyon France in 2009. He was a Research Engineer at the Exaprotect Company, France during seven years. His research focus began on IS Security especially on Anomaly intrusion detection system. Currently, he's a member of the engineers School of [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School) as associate professor. His experience into behavior modeling helps him to integrate the robotic research team of the school. He joins the [CITI Lab](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) in 2015 and becomes associate members of the [CHROMA INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/) team. Research interests are focused on Human and Robot Interaction and especially on managing robot fleet to deliver service to human into crowed environment.

- Olivier Simonin received his B.Sc., M.Sc. and PhD in Computer Science in 1995, 1997 and 2001 respectively, from Université Montpellier II (LIRMM Laboratory), France. From 2002 to 2006 he was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at UTBM "Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbeliard" (France) and a member of the SeT laboratory (Systems and Transport) in the multiagent team (ICAP). In 2006, he joined the LORIA Laboratory in Nancy as a member of the INRIA project-team MaIA (Autonomous and Intelligent Machines) and, in 2007, became Associate Professor at Université de Lorraine (Nancy 1). In 2010, he completed his habilitation (French HDR diploma) from Nancy 1 University.
In 2013, he became full Professor at INSA Lyon and CITI-Inria Lab., joining the team Dynamid. In 2015, he created the INRIA team CHROMA (Cooperative and Human-aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments), merging some members of Dynamid and Inria eMotion teams.
His main research topics are i) decentralized decision making in distributed autonomous robots and multi-agent systems, ii) bio-inspired algorithms for problem solving and iii) study of self-organized properties in collective systems (swarm robotics, spatial computing, reactive MAS). His main application domains are mobile robotics, autonomous vehicles and intelligent environements. Since 2002, he has published 12 articles in international journals and books and about 30 international conference long papers (as in AAMAS, IROS, ICRA, IJCAI, ECAI, SAB, etc.). He has co-supervized 8 PhD. students (three are in progress) and many Master students. He was the initiator of two european PHC project with Czech Rep. (J. Faigl 2014-15) and Slovenia (D. Matko 2006-09) and an active member of several international and national projects (e.g. "InTraDe" european project, STIC-Asie "Scout", ANR "Pherotaxis", REI-DGA "Susie", "Smaart"). In 2012 he has won the French ANR Robotics challenge "Carotte" as a member of the "Cartomatic" team and coordinator of the Maia partner.


- Christian Wolf is associate professor (Maitre de Conférences, HDR) at [INSA de Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr) and [LIRIS UMR 5205](http://liris.cnrs.fr), a [CNRS](http://cnrs.fr) laboratory, since 2005. Since sept. 2017 he is on leave at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr) at the [Chroma](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/chroma) robotics work group and the [CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/). He is interested in computer vision and machine learning, deep learning, especially in the visual analysis of complex scenes in motion: gesture and activity recognition and pose estimation. In his work he puts an emphasis on models of complex interactions, on Deep Learning and on structured models. He received his MSc in computer science from Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) in 2000, and a PhD in computer science from INSA de Lyon, France, in 2003. In 2012 he obtained the habilitation diploma, also from INSA de Lyon.

- Raphael Leber is assistant professor in [CPE Lyon](https://www.cpe.fr) (Engineering School) since 2014. He develops robotic platorms and teaches in the "service robotics" major. Before working as an academic, he gained a relevant experience in a [Korean robotic laboratory](http://irl.postech.ac.kr), in a [former french robotic company](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en) and in a [company specialized in embedded systems](https://www.viveris.fr/index.php/viveris-technologies.html) (R&D and then R&I). He holds a Master’s Degree in Embedded Electronics from the University of Technology of Belfort-Montbéliard, 2010.

- Laetitia Matignon is an associate professor at [University Claude Bernard Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr) in the [LIRIS UMR 5205](http://liris.cnrs.fr) laboratory, [SMA](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipes?id=74) (Multi-Agent System) team, since 2012. For the years 2016-2018,  she is also an associated member of the [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr) at the [Chroma](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/chroma) robotics work group and the [CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/).  She is interested  in Artificial Intelligence (AI),  especially decision processes under uncertainty (planification, reinforcement learning, developmental learning) and their applications to robotics (multi-robot and human-robot systems). She hold her Ph.D. in computer science and automatics from Franche-Comte University in December 2008, with a thesis on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning and its application to the control of a micro-manipulation distributed system. As a post-doctoral researcher at University of Caen in MAD team of [GREYC](https://archive-www.greyc.fr/index.html) laboratory, she was involved in the CAROTTE NRA-DGA project, a french robotic competition concerning the autonomous exploration and mapping of an unknown environment with mobile robotic systems.
